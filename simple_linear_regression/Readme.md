**Linear regression** is one of the most popular supervised learning algorithms. It is also simple and among the best understood in statistics and machine learning.

Linear regression is a basic type of predictive analysis. The general concept of regression is to study two issues:

  - Does a set of predictor variables predict an outcome variable?
  
  - which variables are most significant and have the greatest impact on the outcome variable?
  
These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
The simplest form of the regression equation with one dependent variable and one independent variable is defined by the formula 
**y = c + b * x**, where **y = estimated dependent variable, c = constant, b = regression coefficient** and **x = independent variable**. 
This is called [**Simple Linear Regression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression).
